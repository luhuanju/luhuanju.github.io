# Grant's Website

Hey there! You've made it to the repo for my personal website. Not sure why you'd want to keep up to date on changes to it, but if you do then here's the place to be.

## Building the Site

While you're here you might as well learn something. This site runs on [GitHub Pages](http://github.io/) and is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Here's how you can build the site:

1. Clone the repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/grantmcconnaughey/grantmcconnaughey.github.io.git
    ```

2. Change directories:

    ```
    cd grantmcconnaughey.github.io
    ```

3. Install Jekyll:

    ```
    gem install jekyll
    ```

4. Serve up the site:

    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in your browser.
