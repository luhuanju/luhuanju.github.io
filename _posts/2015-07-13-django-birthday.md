It's time that I finally start a blog. I've put it off for far too long. And after spending a weekend with some of the more important folks in the Django world, I suppose you could say I've found a bit of inspiration. Here goes nothing.

[Django Birthday](https://djangobirthday.com/) was last weekend (July 10, 2015 - July 12, 2015) in downtown Lawrence, Kansas. It was a celebration of 10 years of Django and it was a great way to meet some of the key players in the Django community. The three co-founders (Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Adrian Holovaty, and Simon Willison) were in attendance. Other core contributors, members of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/), and leaders of groups like [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) were all in attendance.

The first night consisted of a quick meet and greet. Some of the attendees met up at [Henry's](https://www.facebook.com/henryscoffeeshop) around 5:00. Around 7:30 to 8:00 we split up into groups of 8 and headed off to dinner. My coworker Edward Emanuel and I managed to get a dinner with the three co-founders of Django. I felt like a fly on the wall listening to stories from developers who have decades more experience than I do.

On Saturday we spent the day listening to talks from the important figures of the Django community. The talks ranged from the educational in Marc Tamlyn's "Development Milestones: 1.0 Onwards", to the funny in Andrew Godwin's "Django: The Conspiracy", to the emotional in Adrian Holovaty's "Django Regrets".

After the talks we headed to the offices of [Lawrence Journal-World](http://www2.ljworld.com/) where Djano was founded. It was interesting to see the exact offices where Django was conceived (which was in a basement, believe it or not).

The day culminated in a block party in downtown Larence. There was live music, drinks, food, a talking robot, and (naturally) a bouncey house. Adrian Holovaty played gypsy-jazz guitar for about 30 minutes, and he was genuinely great. Definitely check out [Adrian's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/adrianholovaty) for some sweet acoustic jams.

On Sunday the attendees met up at the Carnegie Building for sprints. Most attendees worked on open tickets in the Django codebase. Edward and I took a different approach and instead opted to add easter eggs to SideKick. It was time well spent.

Overall, Django Birthday was a fun experience and a great first technical conference for me. I have to thank SideCars for making it possible. They didn't hesitate to pay for tickets, food, a hotel, and a rental car so that Edward and I could attend the conference. Now on to DjangoCon 2015!
